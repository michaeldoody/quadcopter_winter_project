# Quadcopter Winter Project
## How to use

The quadcopter that was designed for this project is flown with an RC transmitter. Autonomous flight by connecting a Raspberry Pi 4 to the flight controller is the next step. Here's how to fly the drone using the RC:

1. Make sure that your batteries are fully charged (I used a 2700mAh 3s 40c Lipo). Secure the battery to between the upper and lower frame using Velcro straps.
2. Attach the propellers to the motor shafts oriented correctly so that they provided an upward lift depending on the direction the motor spins. Fasten each propeller with the shaft nuts.
3. Connect the battery cable to the power distribution board cable.
4. Find a spacious area to fly, put on a pair of safety glasses, and step back from the drone about ten feet.
5. Turn on the transmitter and arm the drone by bringing the throttle to zero and yaw to the right.
6. Keep the pitch and roll controls centered as you gently throttle up to several feet off the ground.
7. Have fun flying!
8. When finished, slowly throttle down for a soft landing.
